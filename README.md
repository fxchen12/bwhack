Inspired by the mouseover of xkcd comic 903 - http://xkcd.com/903/ - which claims that “if you take any article, click on the first link in the article text not in parentheses or italics, and then repeat, you will eventually end up at Philosophy”, this codebase parses Wikipedia articles to find their first non-italicized, non-parenthetical links and visualizes the data in a graph.
